# Data Architecture
The design of the data architecture of this is based on Medallion Architecture **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**:

![Data Architecture](https://github.com/OpsyGotti/sql-data-warehouse-project/blob/main/docs/images/Data_Architecture.drawio.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: This will store the data in its raw form from the data sources. Data will be ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to ensure data quality and consistency for accurate analysis
3. **Gold Layer**: Stores business-ready data structured in a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.
