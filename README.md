# Data Architecture
The design of the data architecture of this is based on Medallion Architecture **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**:

1. **Bronze Layer**: This will store the data in its raw form from the data sources. Data will be ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to ensure data quality and consistency for accurate analysis
3. **Gold Layer**: Stores business-ready data structured in a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.

# Project Overview
This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze, Silver and Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimised for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports for actionable insights.

This project repository is an excellent resource highlighting the following expertise in:
- SQL Development
- Data Architect
- Data Engineering
- ETL Pipeline Developer

# ðŸš€Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- ** Data Sources **: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- ** Data Quality **: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- ** Integration **: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- ** Scope **: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- ** Documentation **: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
